######  Wrangling   ########


## 1) Importing Spreadsheets

# A spreadsheet is a file version of a Data Frame

# For a simple text file, a new row is definedwith a return
# A new column is defined with a space, comma, tab, semicolon

# It is important to know if a file has a header or not

# Generally it is not recommended to use Excel, but text file, google spreadsheets, etc.


## 2) Paths and the Working Directory

# Important to know your working directory

getwd()   # to see the working directory
setwd()   # to set the working directory

# Unless a full path is provided , they search for files in the working directory

system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")   # looks for the directory extdata of the package dslabs

path <- system.file("extdata", package="dslabs")
filename <- "murders.csv"
fullpath <- file.path(path, filename)
list.files(path)   # shows files in the specified directory
file.copy(fullpath, getwd())    # copies files into wd

file.exists(filename)   # checks if the file exists in your wd


## 3) The readr and readxl Package

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# readr tidyverse package that reads data in txt files into R

read_table()    # white space separated values
read_csv()      # comma separated values
read_csv2()     # semicolon separated values
read_tsv()      # tab delimited separated values 
read_delim()    # general text file format, must define delimiter

read_excel()    # auto-detects formal .xls or .xlsx
read_xls()      # reads xls
read_xlsx()     # reads xlsx

excel_sheets()  # gives us the names of the sheets in an excel file

read_lines()    # shows us the first few lines of a file in R

read_lines(
  "C:/Users/wiers/Desktop/Data Science/Data-Science-Tutorial/murders/data/murders.csv", 
  n_max=3)      # max number of rows, also shows if header

# since murders has headers and has , we use read_csv

# the imported data is a tibble


## 4) Importing Data using R-base Functions

# R- base has similar functions, but they create dataframe, not a tibble
# Characters are converted to factors, can be avoided by setting stringsAsFactors=FALSE

read.table("murders.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
read.csv()
read.delim()


## 5) Downloading Files from the Internet

# We can read files in directly from the web

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"

dat <- read_csv(url)

download.file(url, "murders.csv")   # lets you download the file to have a local copy

tempdir()   # creates a directory with a name that is very unlikely not to be unique
tempfile()  # creates a file that is likely to be a unique file name

file.remove()   # removes a file


## 6) Tidy Data
