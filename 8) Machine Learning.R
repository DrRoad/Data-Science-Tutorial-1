########   Machine Learning   #############


## 1) Notation

# Outcome we want to predict (output) & features we use to predict the outcome (input)

# Y - outcome     X_1 through X_p - features (predictors, covariates)

# Prediction outcomes: categorical Y can be any of K classes  k = 1,...,K, or continuous

# Y_hat to denote prediction
# actual outcome - what we ended up observing

# When outcome is categorical - classification   - right or wrong
 
# when outcome is continuous - prediction   - error

# First step: what are the outcomes, what are the features?


## 2) Caret package, training and test sets, and overall accuracy
